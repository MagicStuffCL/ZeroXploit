# ZeroXploit
Instructions :

1 - Replace html folder in /usr <br>
2 - I recommend deleting the html folder and copying the new one, since I removed some bins that I don't use in my case, you can add these bins if you wish in the custom folder<br>
3 - Are free to copy, modify and adapt to your needs, please mention me in the credits =)<br>
