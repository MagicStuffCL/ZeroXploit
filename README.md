Instructions :

1 - Replace html folder in /usr <br>
2 - Copy ntplib.py to /usr/lib/python3.7/ (or the python folder that your raspberry has) <br>
3 - If you wish you can edit the file /usr/html/Resources/py/ftpTrainerUpdate.py , and in line 79 configure the ntp server of your choice <br>
4 - The update of the trainer takes a few minutes and if the page is closed it will continue processing the update, if the page is left open for a moment it will show a  message that the trainer has been updated, when re-entering 
    the trainer page you should see the date it was updated in the bottom of the page <br>(please read the instructions on the page)<br>
5 - I recommend deleting the html folder and copying the new one, since I removed some bins that I don't use in my case,<br> you can add these bins if you wish in the custom folder<br>
6 - Are free to copy, modify and adapt to your needs, please mention me in the credits =)<br>
